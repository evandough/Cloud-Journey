# Azure DevOps Boards

## Introduction

Whilst working and studying for the AZ-400 I came across **Azure DevOps Boards**. This is almost like a ticketing system but with more capabilities. Essentially **Azure DevOps Boards** can be looked at as: 
- **Tickets** = Work Items — These can be bugs, tasks, user stories, epics, etc.
- **Boards** = Visualization — Kanban or Scrum boards help you manage and move those tickets through different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.).

This is epic because Boards offer: 
1. **Agile Planning**: Supports Scrum, Kanban, and custom workflows.
2. **Customizable Work Items**: Tailor work items to fit team processes.
3. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enables team visibility and communication.
4. **Integrated Tracking**: Link code commits, builds, and releases directly to work items.
5. **Dashboards & Reporting**: Visualize progress with built-in analytics.
6. **Scalability**: Suitable for small teams (**LIKE ME!**)to large enterprises.

## Use Case

When it comes to what I want to study, what I am studying, planning labs I want to do, labs I'm currently doing, etc., etc., it's nice to have a set plan. Same thing with work - goals are set and a plan of action is created. **Scrum** is breaking big, complex work into smaller, prioritized, shippable chunks, delivering frequently, and adjusting as you go. I've been trying to shift the way I look at my own projects to mimic exactly this and what better way than to implement this with my own work. 

## Cloud Research

- Microsoft has a GitHub that walks you through how to do this [HERE](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/AZ400_M01_L01_Agile_Plan_and_Portfolio_Management_with_Azure_Boards.md) 

## Implementation

I've created a project within **Azure DevOps** to get more hands-on experience with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and I've created tickets for:
- Creating a Service Connection
- Creating a Key Vault to connect to Azure DevOps to securely deploy resources
- Creating Variable Groups to then have access to Key Vaults to enhance security

There's excitement in dragging a ticket from the **To-Do** section to the **In-Progress** and the to the **Done** section. Bonus points if you close a ticket directly from a commit in VSCode. P U R E B L I S S
