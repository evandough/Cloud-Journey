# Service Connection Creation - Azure / Azure DevOps

## Introduction

This project was created to automate resource creation - connecting **Azure** with **Azure DevOps**. I wanted to create & test Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using ARM Templates. 

## Prerequisite

You will need an **Azure** account and an **Azure DevOps** account. 

## Cloud Research

- [THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpa7r_iXgM8) helped me create the Service Connection.
- Service Connection was created with appropriate permissions to deploy to Azure. 

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è The hands-on experience is great. When I first set up the Service Connection it was fun to figure out **WHO ARE YOU** and **WHAT CAN YOU DO**, when it comes to identity and permissions. 
<br></br>
I was able to deploy **Virtual Machines (VMs)** successfully, but that write up will come at a later time üòÉ
