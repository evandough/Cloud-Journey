# Created Budget

## Introduction

Did this to make sure I didn't have a hefty bill at the end of the month. 
If I can't budget my own subscription, then who's going to trust me with their subscription?

## Prerequisite

Gotta have an Azure subscription to set up a budget, so go ahead and get yourself signed up!

## Cloud Research

- Found this quite insightful: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/analyze-costs-create-budgets-azure-cost-management/
- Great way to learn about cost & budget with some follow-along at the end

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- Budget has officially been setup. Really hope that I don't exceed my $1/month budget :)
